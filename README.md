# Comparison_of_Higher_Order_Moments_Portfolio
This project explores the incorporation of higher-order moments (skewness, kurtosis, and beyond) into portfolio optimization to enhance the performance of investment portfolios. Traditional mean-variance optimization often falls short in capturing the real-world complexities of asset return distributions, which can exhibit significant skewness and kurtosis. This study aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of risk and return dynamics by integrating these higher-order moments into the portfolio construction process.
